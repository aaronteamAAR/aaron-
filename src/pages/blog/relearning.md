As a web developer, it's important to constantly improve and update your skills. For me, that recently meant revisiting and relearning two important JavaScript libraries: React and Next.js.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components that can be easily rendered on the frontend. One of the key benefits of using React is that it allows for efficient rendering of dynamic content, making it a great choice for building modern, interactive web applications.

Next.js is a framework built on top of React that makes it easy to build server-rendered React applications. It provides a simple way to build universal, server-rendered React apps that are optimized for performance.

I found that relearning React and Next.js was a great opportunity to brush up on my skills and gain a deeper understanding of these powerful tools. It's been a fun and rewarding experience, and I'm excited to continue using React and Next.js in my work as a web developer.
As a web developer, I had to relearn react js and next js recently, prompting me to wonder why! After weeks of research and practice using both technologies simultaneously â€“ here is my story. 

I found that re-learning those two technologies together can be quite useful for developers who want to increase their productivity while not compromising on quality or having any pain from the technology involved. It provides an efficient way for them to quickly create apps or websites with better performance since both frameworks are easy to use and built on language already familiar to JavaScript developers like myself. Plus, developing projects becomes faster as you no longer have worry about writing code from scratch; instead, you leverage existing components from popular libraries such as Material UI/Bootstrap or Preact/Ant Design etc.
