## 📚 Stack

- Platform: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- Deployment: [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── pages/
└── package.json
```


Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
